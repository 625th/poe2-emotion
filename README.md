# poe2-emotion

I am not a coder so all of this should be used at your own risk.
All of the code was written using GPT sources so there may still be some errors or problems even though I tried to test it out.

Parser scrapes info from [poe2db](https://poe2db.tw/) and puts it into a JSON.
It is used in scripts in index.html to be used in similar way as [blight calculator](https://blight.raelys.com/) by [Raelys](https://github.com/mattantonelli)

I'll try to keep info updated but it can be outdated.

You are free to fork and make a better version!

P.S. Dockerfile was used purely for local testing
